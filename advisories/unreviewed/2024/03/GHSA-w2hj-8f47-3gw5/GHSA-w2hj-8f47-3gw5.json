  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: fix potential key use-after-free\n\nWhen ieee80211_key_link() is called by ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add()\nbut returns 0 due to KRACK protection (identical key reinstall),\nieee80211_gtk_rekey_add() will still return a pointer into the\nkey, in a potential use-after-free. This normally doesn't happen\nsince it's only called by iwlwifi in case of WoWLAN rekey offload\nwhich has its own KRACK protection, but still better to fix, do\nthat by returning an error code and converting that to success on\nthe cfg80211 boundary only, leaving the error for bad callers of\nieee80211_gtk_rekey_add().",
